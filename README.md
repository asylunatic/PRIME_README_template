# About this project
Explain the aim of the applet and briefly describe how it works (for the user). Tell what it is with context. E.g.  
This 4D rotations applet gives insight in how the monstrosities of quaternions work. Students can play with the parameters and use it to answer the accompaying Grasple exercises. This applet has been developed as part of the course material for mathematics at TU Delft.

# Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps:

## Prerequisites
List the things you need to use the software and how to install them.  
e.g.  
1) Install npm via https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm  
2) Ensure the installation is up to date  
```npm install npm@latest -g```

## Installation
Describe the steps that are required to set up the project from scratch. List specific steps to remove ambiguity and enables other to use your project as quickly as possible. E.g.:
1) Get a free API Key at https://example.com  
2) Clone the repo  
```git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git```  
3) Install NPM packages  
```npm install```  
4) Enter your API in config.js  
```const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';```

## Usage
Explain how to run the project. Use examples! Also: show the expected output when applicable.
